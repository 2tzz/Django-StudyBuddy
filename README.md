## üîç What is Django REST Framework?

[Django REST Framework (DRF)](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) is a powerful toolkit for building **Web APIs** with Django.  
It lets you expose your data as **JSON endpoints**, making it easy to:

- Connect a frontend like React or Vue
- Power mobile apps
- Reuse logic between the web and API
- Support CRUD operations programmatically

### Example DRF View:
```python
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from .models import Room
from .serializers import RoomSerializer

class RoomListView(APIView):
    def get(self, request):
        rooms = Room.objects.all()
        serializer = RoomSerializer(rooms, many=True)
        return Response(serializer.data)
```
